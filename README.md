# COM SCI 88S: Introduction to Human-Centered Design in iOS Applications

This repository contains all the lectures and slides for the UCLA class COM SCI 88S, taught in Spring 2019.

Slides that have a **red line** at the top are extra notes that were not included when the actual lecture was given. They typically contain ideas discussed in class that are not discernible from the original slides alone.
